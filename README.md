## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap5
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue Js](https://vuejs.org/) - Fast-rising Javascript framework

### What I learned

What stood out for me in this particular project is how to use REGEX, how to implement watchers and use computed properties to carry out amazing tasks.

Some code snippet here:

```js
// For Email validation
const isEmail = computed(() => {
  const emailRegex =
    /^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&â€™*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*$/;
  return emailRegex.test(formData.value.email);

  // To disable button by default
  const isBtnDissabled = computed(() => {
    return formData.value.email == "";
  });

  // conditions for validation and watchers
  const validateEmail = () => {
    if (formData.value.email) {
      router.push({
        name: "confirmation",
        params: { email: formData.value.email },
      });
      if (isEmail.value) {
        return isEmail;
      }
    }
  };

  watch(formData, validateEmail);
});
```

### Continued development

Looking forwars to implement custom vue loader. And that will be implemented soon. So watch out for it

### Useful resources

- [Vue Watchers](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/watchers.html) - This helped in handling my computed properties well.
- [Vue Computed Properties](https://www.example.com) - This give me good insight on how to use computed properties very well -[AbstractApi](https://www.abstractapi.com/tools/email-regex-guide) - More Examples on how to use regex
